Poor Things,80,"Generally loved the style and direction and was very funny, although the sex scenes got a bit excessive and felt some bits were just weird for the sake of it without actually contributing to character development or story."
Godzilla Minus One,70,"Overall decent, and better storyline than the Hollywood ones, although I found the actual Godzilla creature a bit underwhelming. The bit where the plane flies into it's mouth but doesn't explode for a few seconds was very strange."
Society of the Snow,90,"Very good. No corners were cut with cheap sets/CGI, the film was shot at the actual location of the real crash. It also didn't shy away from showing the gory details, so we fully appreciate what they went through."
Maestro,60,"Not bad but also not particularly interesting. There was potential to explore some deep themes such as being Jewish and homosexual in the 1940s, but neither were really delved into. While the film lacks substance it does however contain strong performances from the lead actor/actress, especially Carey Mulligan, both worthy of their Oscar nominations."
