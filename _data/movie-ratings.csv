Poor Things,80,"Generally loved the style and direction and was very funny, although the sex scenes got a bit excessive and felt some bits were just weird for the sake of it without actually contributing to character development or story."
Godzilla Minus One,70,"Overall decent, and better storyline than the Hollywood ones, although I found the actual Godzilla creature a bit underwhelming. The bit where the plane flies into it's mouth but doesn't explode for a few seconds was very strange."
Society of the Snow,90,"Very good. No corners were cut with cheap sets/CGI, the film was shot at the actual location of the real crash. It also didn't shy away from showing the gory details, so we fully appreciate what they went through."
Maestro,60,"Not bad but also not particularly interesting. There was potential to explore some deep themes such as being Jewish and homosexual in the 1940s, but neither were really delved into. While the film lacks substance it does however contain strong performances from the lead actor/actress, especially Carey Mulligan, both worthy of their Oscar nominations."
Dark Waters,70,"An eye-opening true story. I liked how some people from the real case appeared in the movie. Although I think some focus should have been shifted away from the trial and more time given to showing victims and how the chemicals affected their lives, to emotionally engage the viewer more."
Saltburn,60,"The cinematography was beautiful, shot in 35mm it has a distinct look from its saturation and contrast. However, the movie is let down by a farfetched plot with many holes. In the end we’re left feeling unfulfilled and lacking an understanding of Oliver’s motivations, was it money, jealousy, or spitefulness?"
Killers of the Flower Moon,80,"Stellar performances from Dicaprio and DeNiro, as always. Classic Scorsese themes while exploring an era/culture not often portrayed in Hollywood. Wasn’t a fan of the musical score and felt it detracted from the seriousness of some of the scenes. It was surprisingly engaging for a 3.5 hour long film, but still, films this long should not be a thing."
About My Father,40,"Painfully predictable. Cheesy but a few laughs nonetheless."
Anatomy of a Fall,75,"An interesting twist on the classic murder mystery genre, but with only 1 suspect in this case. Phenomenal acting from all the cast. There’s a major feeling of frustration after watching this movie, as in the end there’s no explanation or twist and we don’t know how to feel about Sandra."
The Iron Claw,80,"An unbelievably depressing true story. Overall very good but a bit slow in parts. Despite the extensive tragedies this story contains, there were no real tear-jerker moments, due to a lack of deep dialogue and missing emotion portrayed in the characters in some pivotal moments."
The Zone of Interest,50,"Disappointing for a film with such potential. The idea was strong, to show the contrast between a concentration camp and those who live on the other side. But although we already have some understanding of the atrocities that occurred inside the camps, the viewer is never shown any of this and thus little emotion is evoked. We are left watching the mundane day-to-day lives of a household."
Nyad,70,"An incredibly inspiring true story. We never really feel like we’re fully rooting for the protagonist to succeed as she’s extremely selfish and only wants what’s best for her."
99 Homes,70,"A good story of moral dilemmas and some interesting lessons about the U.S. housing crisis. Good performances from Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, but mediocre for the rest of the cast. Decent overall but no particularly stand out moments."
Gerald's Game,40,"Usually a big fan of Stephen King adaptations, but this one falls short in so many ways. Having not read the book myself, I can’t completely comment in which ways the book and the film are to blame separately. There were some tense/scary moments, but all of these seemed to be cut short and momentum was lost. Having Jessie hallucinating after a mere half a day was just ludicrous. Some decent artistic shots involving the flashbacks was this film’s only saving grace."
Defiance,65,"A different perspective on the holocaust than we are usually shown in films. We are shown the story of those who were able to fight back despite their difficult situation. Decent overall, nothing particularly amazing though."
Dune: Part Two,85,"A lot better than the first instalment in many ways. A much more engaging and action-packed storyline. Visually stunning cinematography from Villeneuve, as usual. Great character played by Austin Butler, much smaller than his brother in stature and build, but somehow more intimidating and villainous. Some things didn’t really make sense though, like why does everyone fight with swords when they have access to guns and other technologically advanced weaponry, but I guess sword fights make for better action scenes."
The Aviator,65,"Started very strong but really started to drag in the 2nd half. Perhaps the only film I’ve seen to depict struggles with OCD and it was interesting to see his deterioration throughout the film. At first I found the colour grading very jarring and over-the-top, but later discovered it was intentionally used to emulate the technicolor film stock that was used during that period, which in hindsight was a clever and unique technique. Although relevant to tell Hugh’s story, I found the lawsuit related sections quite dull."
