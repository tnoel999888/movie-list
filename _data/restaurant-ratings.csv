Mowgli (Leeds),70,"Good starters/sides, room for improvement with the mains. Cardamon Old Fashioned was great"
Jacuzzi (London),70,"Decent food and decor, and 'The Golden Age' cocktail was amazing. However, the menu wasn't as extensive as I was expecting."

Bono (Lisbon),80,"Great service, cosy atmosphere and tasty food. Would recommend the creamy rice with pulled beef rib!"
Dear Breakfast (Lisbon),70,"Decent food. Tried the halloumi pancake which was quite unique and nice. Would have preferred the fried eggs not to have any runny whites however."
Crossroad10 (Lisbon),75,"Nice food, although the menu was very small and the waiter wasn‚Äôt even sure what the dessert was"
Yakuza by Olivier (Lisbon),95,"Very good food, although very pricey. Amazing decor and nice vibe inside."
The Folks (Lisbon),80,"Very good presentation of food and nice vibe. Wish we could have swapped the choice of bread free of charge however."
Azzurra (London),60,"It was ok, but very overpriced and gimicky. ¬£39 for some spaghetti and a single prawn. ¬£20 for some sorbet mixed with Prosecco and sold as a fancy 'cocktail'. And a ¬£15 Tiramisu made at the table just for show. We were disappointed to not be allowed to take the leftover food home in a box."
House of Koko (Leeds),90,"Food was amazing, particularly enjoyed the Moroccan Chicken Sandwhich. Great service and dog-friendly too!"

Casa Del Mar (Albufeira),80,"Good food, views and service!"
Portugal Rocks Brunch Bar & Cafe (Albufeira),40,"Good food and nice friendly staff, but overall a poor experience due to the extremely slow service. From being seated it took an hour to receive our food, and it wasn‚Äôt even busy."
Mar√® (Lagos),80,"A nice and affordable buffet for meat lovers in particular"
Lagos Beer & Co,5,"Came here for some drinks and the waitress said we should try some Portuguese liqueur shots, it was heavily implied that these were free, and we have received free shots at other bars/restaurants in this area, but these were then added at ‚Ç¨3 each on our bill. Extremely cheeky thing to do, taking advantage of tourists, avoid this place.
We mentioned this to them but they said the shots were obviously not free and made us pay, they knew exactly what they were doing and it was not an honest miscommunication."
